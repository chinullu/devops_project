# devops_project
Initially I created an ubuntu instance in AWS.
Installed open source puppetmaster in it.
Installed the AWS module
Installed sdk gems 
For AWS access credentials I have set the AWSaccesskeyID and AWSsecretaccesskey.
Now installed the puppetlabs-aws module.
I have wrote the init.pp to create two instances, securitygroup, vpc, loadbalancer.
